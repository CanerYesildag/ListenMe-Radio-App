CSE3044 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING LECTURE PROJECT

Project Name:  ListenMe

Today, radios are an indispensable choice for people who want to listen to different music. But switching between these radio channels and finding their frequencies is a very demanding task. Based on this, we aim to provide more convenience to our users by gathering more than one radio channel under the same roof.
 In our application, there will be a handy interface that can be used by every person, a search screen where he/she can search for the radio channel of his/her choice and a favorites list where he can add his favorite radio channels.   
  On the other hand, we will do some new adds. One of them is recording a radio channel with only a record button. While listening any of radio channels, users can record whatever they like. Any other new add is controlling with voice of user. If any user is far from the device can control the application with his/her voice. 
We will take advantage of Android Studio while developing our application.
